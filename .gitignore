# Ignore everything in the repository
*

# Don't ignore the .gitignore file itself
!.gitignore

# Don't ignore the .gitkeep file (to preserve folder structure)
!.gitkeep

# Ignore all folders (and their contents) except .gitkeep
test/*

# But keep the .gitkeep file inside the test folder
!test/.gitkeep

# If you have subfolders within the test folder, this ensures they are ignored
test/*/
!test/*/.gitkeep

# You can add similar rules for other folders you want to ignore
# For example, if you have a data folder:
# /data/*
# !/data/.gitkeep
# !/data/*/.gitkeep
